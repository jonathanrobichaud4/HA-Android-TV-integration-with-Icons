# HA-Android-TV-integration-with-Icons
Home Assistant Android TV Integration but with active app icons.

Icons go into www folder (also local, its a little confusing) 
**DON'T CHANGE THE PICTURE NAMES OR ELSE THEY WON'T WORK.** 

If some icons don't work see if the app name is different on your Android TV Device as it could be. 
I made this modification usung a Chromecast with Google TV.

Integration goes into custom_components. 

If you would like to add icons you can feel free to make a PR!
